Description: The irregularly-spaced data are interpolated onto regular latitude-longitude grids by weighting each station according to its distance and angle from the center of a search radius. In addition to this, a simple method which gridding the irregularly-spaced data points onto regular latitude-longitude grids by averaging all points in grid-boxes was also provided.
